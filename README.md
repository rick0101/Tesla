# Tesla

In this application I tried to organize the data of my tesla's powerwall app, for some needs. 
In the application, before 08/2023, there was no options for visualize data from a specific day to another, and that's give me the ispiration to create this app. 

I know it's a really basic prompt's application, but I created it as my first "project" on python, without any external help.
Now the Tesla's application has been updates and my applications isn't useful anymore but anyways I enjoyed coding it
